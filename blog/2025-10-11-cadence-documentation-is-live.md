## What You'll Find Here

Our comprehensive documentation hub provides everything you need to get the most out of Cadence.day. Here are some highlights:

- **Getting Started Guides**: Step-by-step instructions to help you set up and start using Cadence quickly.
- **Feature Guides**: Detailed explanations of Cadence's core features including activity tracking, note-taking, reflections, and privacy.
- **FAQ Section**: Answers to common questions about accounts, activities, notes, encryption, calendar features, notifications, and subscriptions.
- **Troubleshooting**: Solutions to common issues you might encounter.

## Why We Built This

As Cadence continues to grow, we wanted to create a central knowledge base where users can find answers, learn about features, and get the most value from the app. Whether you're a new user or have been with us from the beginning, these docs will help you discover features you might have missed.

## What's Next?

The documentation will be regularly updated as we add new features and improve existing ones. We're also planning to add:

- User case studies
- Advanced guides for power users

## Get Started

Explore the [documentation](/docs/intro) today to enhance your Cadence experience. If you haven't downloaded the app yet, get it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/cadence-day/id6745115112).
