The seven-day week is so embedded in human civilization that we rarely pause to question it. 

On the closer look it becomes indisputable this ancient unit of time dating back to Mesopotamia has shaped how humanity organizes itself more profoundly than any other temporal measure.

Throughout human history, different cultures have grappled with time's nature. 

Eastern traditions saw time as cyclical, repeating cosmic cycles of creation, preservation, destruction, and renewal. Abrahamic religions introduced linear, directional history moving toward an eschatological end. Greek philosophy gave us Chronos - measurable time - and Kairos - opportune moments within the flow.

Outside of the definitons, if we pause to thinking about conceptual division of time, a week has shaped human civilization more than any other unit and we are at 'Cadence' are fascinated with it.

The seven-day week dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, tied to lunar phases and the seven visible celestial bodies: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn. 

It was adopted widely through Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. The reason week as a unit seems to work, is becasue it is rooted in multiple dimensions:

- The lunar cycle gave it natural anchor
- The seven planets gave it cosmic authority  
- The sacred number seven gave it symbolic power

The week transformed disorder into order. It created a repeating rhythm that structured religion, work, community, and culture in ways no other time unit achieved. 

We are grounding our product in significance of the week, and are using it to create a cyclical reflective framework that we utilize to adjust the way we think about the flow of time. 

Our perspective is derived from the lifestyle that we lead away from the 9-5 order of work, which allows us a flexibility to observe the flow of time, and create a structure that is more naturally aligns with our individually unique rhythms. 

Our mission is to create a system that allows the individual to tap into Kairos time, and to discover the moments and periods that contain unique opportunities for specific actions and activites, and orient the life around the concept of timing as oppose to the concept of linear time.

## The Cadence Philosophy

Our approach recognizes that through observation, individuals discover their actual pattern, a unique temporal structure that differs from abstracted ideals. Just as a farmer plants in spring and harvests in autumn, human actions ideally follow the unique natural flow of life.

This is where the ancient concept of Wu Wei (effortless action) becomes relevant. Wu Wei is about aligning with the timing of cycles, acting in harmony with natural rhythms to ensure success without strain.

## How Cadence Works

Cadence combines units of cyclical time with sets of abstracted activities, allowing users to:


- **Record and oberve patterns at multiple scales**:  
Hour, day, week, month, year
- **Discover their authentic rhythm**:  
Moving from "unrealistic ideal" → "discovered pattern" → "actual ideal"
- **Visualize temporal structure**:  
See their week as an ornament, a beautiful complex pattern unique to them
- **Organize with awareness**:  
Understand energy distribution, identify high and low energy periods, and align activities with natural rhythms

The goal is to develope the system that allow us not to frantically schedule, but to first understand our relationship with time.

## Why This Matters

From our perspective we are attemptinng to build a new category: temporal self-awareness tools, the suite of products that we feel are currently missing in our culture.

The problem is universal, it appears that majority of us are struggling with time, it is a major source of unease. Our mission is to find a path from time related stress and anxiety to genuine understanding and discovery of individual balance.
