## Answer to Your Question

### "How do I test the logic if my products are not approved yet by App Store?"

**Answer:** Use Apple's **StoreKit Configuration** files!

### The 5-Minute Solution

```bash
# 1. Open Xcode
cd ios && open Cadenceday.xcworkspace

# 2. Create StoreKit Configuration File
# Xcode → File → New → StoreKit Configuration File
# Name: Products.storekit

# 3. Add your products with exact IDs from RevenueCat Dashboard

# 4. Enable in scheme
# Edit Scheme → Options → StoreKit Configuration → Select file

# 5. Rebuild
npx expo run:ios

# 6. Test in app
# Profile → Debug → Test RevenueCat
```

**Result:** ✅ All RevenueCat functionality works locally without App Store approval!

## Why This Error Was Happening

```
⚠️ Warning: RevenueCat products not available - this is expected in development
or when products aren't approved in App Store Connect
```

**Cause:**

- Products not approved in App Store Connect yet
- No local StoreKit Configuration set up
- RevenueCat can't fetch product details from Apple

**This is NORMAL and EXPECTED** during development!

**Solution:**

- StoreKit Configuration provides local product data
- No App Store approval needed
- Instant testing without waiting

---

## Testing Workflow

### Before Setup

```
❌ Products Available: No
❌ Offerings: Empty
❌ Can't test purchases
⏰ Must wait for App Store approval (24-48 hours)
```

### After Setup

```
✅ Products Available: Yes
✅ Offerings: All 3 tiers displayed
✅ Can test all purchases
⚡️ Immediate testing (0 wait time)
```
