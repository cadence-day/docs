## Are my notes encrypted?

## How long can my notes be?

Notes can be as long as you need! There's no character limit, so feel free to capture detailed thoughts, insights, or context about your activities.

## Can I search my notes?

Note search is coming soon! This feature will allow you to search across all your notes to find specific insights or reflections.

## What's the difference between notes and reflections?

- **Notes**: Short thoughts or context added to individual activities (e.g., "Great energy during this workout")
- **Reflections**: Longer-form insights about your day, patterns, or overall well-being.

Both are valuable for understanding your rhythms and growth over time.

## Can I add notes to past activities?

Yes! You can add or edit notes for any past activity:

1. Use the calendar to navigate to a past date
2. Tap on the activity you want to annotate
3. Add or edit your note
4. Changes are saved automatically

## Are notes backed up?

Yes! All notes are automatically synced to the cloud and backed up. You won't lose your reflections if you switch devices or reinstall the app.

## Can I share my notes?

Individual notes are private by default. However, you can manually copy and share specific notes if you choose. We're exploring features to make sharing insights easier while maintaining your privacy.
