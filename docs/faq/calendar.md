# Calendar & Timeline

Learn how to navigate your activities across time in Cadence.

## How does the timeline view work?

The timeline is your main interface for tracking activities:

- **Time slots**: Each row represents a 30-minute period
- **Color-coded blocks**: Activities are shown as colored blocks
- **Scrollable view**: Scroll vertically through the day, horizontally between days
- **Tap to log**: Simply tap any time slot to log an activity

The timeline gives you a visual representation of how you spend your time.

## Can I change the time slot duration?

Currently, time slots are 30 minutes each. We're exploring options to customize this in future updates based on user feedback.

## How do I navigate between days?

There are several ways to navigate:

**Swipe:**
- Swipe left/right on the timeline to move between days

**Calendar picker:**
1. Tap the calendar icon in the header
2. Select any date
3. The timeline updates to show that day

**Today button:**
- Tap the "Today" button to jump back to the current day

## Can I view my week at a glance?

Yes! The **Reflection** screen shows your week in a compact cadence view:
- See all 7 days side-by-side
- Quickly identify patterns and rhythms
- Tap any day to see details

## Does Cadence integrate with my phone's calendar?

Not yet! Calendar integration is a planned feature that will allow you to:
- Import events from your phone's calendar
- See meetings and appointments alongside your activities
- Automatically suggest activities based on calendar events

This feature is coming soon based on user demand.

## Can I view multiple days side-by-side?

The Reflection screen shows your weekly cadence in a grid view. We're exploring additional multi-day views for deeper pattern analysis.

## How far back can I view my data?

You can view your activity history from the day you started using Cadence with no limits! All your data is preserved and accessible.

## Can I set recurring activities?

Recurring activities aren't directly supported yet, but you can:
- Quickly log the same activity for multiple days
- Use patterns from your Reflection view to spot regular activities

Automated recurring activities are on our roadmap!

## What's the difference between the Timeline and Reflection views?

**Timeline (Home screen):**
- Detailed view of a single day
- Log and edit activities in real-time
- See minute-by-minute breakdown

**Reflection:**
- Weekly overview with pattern insights
- Analyze your rhythms and balance
- See total time spent per activity

Use Timeline for daily logging, Reflection for understanding patterns.

## Can I zoom in/out on the timeline?

The timeline is optimized for 30-minute increments. We're considering zoom features for future updates to support different levels of detail.

## How do I see what I did last week?

1. Tap the calendar icon
2. Select a date from last week
3. Or swipe right multiple times to go back day-by-day
