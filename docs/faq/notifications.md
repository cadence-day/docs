# Notifications

Learn how to stay on track with Cadence's notification system.

## What types of notifications does Cadence send?

Cadence can send several types of notifications:

- **Activity reminders**: Prompts to log your activities
- **Reflection reminders**: Encouragement to reflect on your day
- **Pattern insights**: Notifications about interesting patterns in your data
- **Streak celebrations**: Recognition for consistency
- **Update announcements**: Information about new features

## How do I enable notifications?

To enable notifications:

1. Open **Settings** from your profile
2. Tap **Notifications**
3. Enable the types of notifications you want
4. Grant notification permissions when prompted by iOS

You can customize which notifications you receive.

## Can I customize notification times?

Yes! You can set when you want to receive certain notifications:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications**
2. Tap on a notification type
3. Set your preferred time
4. Save your settings

For example, you might want reflection reminders at 9 PM but activity reminders during the day.

## How do I turn off notifications?

To turn off notifications:

**For specific types:**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications**
2. Toggle off the notification types you don't want

**For all notifications:**

1. Go to iOS **Settings**
2. Find **Cadence** in the app list
3. Tap **Notifications**
4. Toggle off **Allow Notifications**

## What are quiet hours?

Quiet hours prevent notifications during times when you don't want to be disturbed:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications**
2. Enable **Quiet Hours**
3. Set your start and end times (e.g., 10 PM - 7 AM)
4. No notifications will be sent during these hours

Perfect for ensuring uninterrupted sleep!

## Will I get spammed with notifications?

No! We're thoughtful about notification frequency:

- **Maximum 3-4 notifications per day** (unless you customize more)
- **Smart timing** based on your patterns
- **No repeated reminders** for the same thing
- **Full control** over what you receive

Quality over quantity!

## Can notifications remind me to log specific activities?

Custom activity reminders are coming soon! This feature will let you:

- Set reminders for specific activities (e.g., "Exercise at 6 AM")
- Get prompted if you haven't logged certain activities
- Build consistency for habits you want to develop

## Do notifications work offline?

Local notifications (like scheduled reminders) work offline. However, pattern insights and dynamic notifications require an internet connection to analyze your data.

## Can I snooze notifications?

Not currently, but snooze functionality is on our roadmap! For now, you can:

- Dismiss notifications you don't need
- Adjust notification times in settings
- Use quiet hours to prevent notifications during specific periods

## What are pattern insight notifications?

Pattern insight notifications alert you to interesting trends in your data:

- "You've exercised 5 days in a row! ðŸŽ‰"
- "Your work-life balance improved this week"
- "You're spending more time on creative activities"

These are sent sparingly (max 1-2 per week) to highlight meaningful patterns.

## How do I change notification sounds?

Currently, Cadence uses the system default notification sound. Custom sounds are planned for a future update!

## Can I get notifications on my Apple Watch?

If you have an Apple Watch paired with your iPhone, Cadence notifications will automatically appear on your watch. Apple Watch app integration is planned for the future!

## Why am I not receiving notifications?

If notifications aren't working:

1. **Check iOS Settings**:
   - Go to Settings > Cadence > Notifications
   - Ensure "Allow Notifications" is enabled

2. **Check App Settings**:
   - Open Cadence > Profile > Settings > Notifications
   - Verify notifications are enabled

3. **Check Quiet Hours**:
   - Make sure you're not in quiet hours

4. **Restart the app**: Sometimes a restart resolves notification issues

## Do notifications drain my battery?

No! Cadence uses iOS's efficient notification system which has minimal battery impact. Our notifications are lightweight and scheduled intelligently.
