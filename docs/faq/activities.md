# Activities

Everything you need to know about tracking and managing activities in Cadence.

## What are activities?

Activities are the building blocks of your day in Cadence. They represent how you spend your time - like working, resting, exercising, or socializing. Each activity has:

- A name (e.g., "Work", "Exercise", "Reading")
- A color for easy visual identification
- A category (Work, Health, Personal, Social, Creative, Learning, Other)

## How do I create an activity?

1. Tap on **"Edit"** on the **Activities** dialog on **Today** screen.
2. Tap the **"+"** button on the top right of the **"Edit Activities"** dialog
3. Enter an activity name
4. Choose a category
5. Pick a color
6. Tap **"Save"** on the top right.

You can also create activities during onboarding.

## Can I edit or delete activities?

Yes! To edit or delete activities:

1. Tap **"Edit Activities"** on the main screen
2. Tap on the activity you want to modify
3. Make your changes or tap **"Delete"** to remove it
4. There will be a confirmation dialog when deleting an activity
   - Tap **"Confirm"** to proceed with deletion
   - Tap **"Cancel"** to abort
5. If you pressed **"Confirm"**, the activity will be deleted from your list, except if you haved logged time with it
   - If you have logged time with the activity, you will see a message indicating that you need to reassign those time blocks before deletion to a new activity.

**Note:** Deleting an activity won't delete your historical data - it just hides the activity from your current list.

## Can I temporarily disable an activity?

Yes! You can temporarily disable activities you're not using:

1. Go to **"Edit Activities"**
2. Tap on the activity
3. Enable **"Temporarily disable activity"**
4. Tap **"Save"**

Disabled activities won't appear when logging time, but you can re-enable them anytime.

## How many activities can I create?

There's no limit! Create as many activities as you need to accurately represent your day. However, we recommend starting with 8-12 core activities and adding more as needed.

## What are activity categories?

Categories help organize your activities:

- **Work**: Professional tasks, meetings, admin
- **Health**: Exercise, meditation, self-care
- **Personal**: Chores, cooking, errands
- **Social**: Time with friends and family
- **Creative**: Hobbies, art, music
