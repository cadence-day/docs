# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them.

## The app won't sync my data

If your data isn't syncing:

1. **Check internet connection**: Ensure you have Wi-Fi or cellular data
2. **Check account**: Make sure you're signed in (Profile > Account)
3. **Force sync**: Pull down on the timeline to manually refresh
4. **Restart app**: Close completely and reopen
5. **Update app**: Check App Store for updates

If problems persist, contact admin@cadence.day.

## I lost my data after updating

Don't worry! Your data is safely stored in the cloud:

1. **Check you're signed in** with the correct account
2. **Wait for sync**: Give the app a few minutes to restore data
3. **Check internet**: Ensure you have a connection
4. **Restart app**: Close and reopen to trigger sync

All data is backed up automatically - it's not lost!

## The app keeps crashing

If Cadence crashes frequently:

1. **Update app**: Check App Store for the latest version
2. **Restart device**: A full device restart often helps
3. **Free up storage**: Ensure you have at least 1GB free space
4. **Reinstall app**: Delete and reinstall from the App Store (your data is cloud-backed!)
5. **Check iOS version**: Update to the latest iOS if possible

If crashes continue, please email admin@cadence.day with your device model and iOS version.

## Activities aren't saving

If activities don't save:

1. **Check internet**: Sync requires connectivity
2. **Look for error messages**: The app will show if something went wrong
3. **Try again**: Tap the activity again to re-log
4. **Check storage**: Ensure device has free space
5. **Restart app**: Close and reopen

Local changes are cached and will sync when connectivity returns.

## I can't sign in

If sign-in fails:

1. **Check internet connection**
2. **Verify email**: Make sure you're using the correct email
3. **Reset password**: Use the "Forgot Password" link
4. **Check email spam**: Password reset emails may be filtered
5. **Try again**: Sometimes server issues are temporary

For persistent issues, contact admin@cadence.day.

## Notifications aren't working

If you're not receiving notifications:

1. **Check iOS Settings**:
   - Settings > Cadence > Notifications
   - Enable "Allow Notifications"

2. **Check app settings**:
   - Cadence > Profile > Settings > Notifications
   - Enable desired notification types

3. **Check Quiet Hours**: Make sure you're not in quiet mode

4. **Restart app**: Close and reopen

5. **Reinstall**: Delete and reinstall if problems persist

## The timeline is showing incorrect times

If times seem off:

1. **Check timezone**: Settings > General > Date & Time
2. **Enable automatic timezone**: Let iOS set your timezone
3. **Restart app**: Close and reopen to refresh
4. **Check activity timestamps**: View activity details to verify

## I'm not seeing my reflection data

If reflection data is missing:

1. **Wait for sync**: Reflections may take a moment to load
2. **Check date**: Make sure you're viewing the correct week
3. **Check internet**: Reflection data syncs from the cloud
4. **Restart app**: Close and reopen

## The app is slow or laggy

If performance is poor:

1. **Restart app**: Close completely and reopen
2. **Restart device**: A device restart often helps
3. **Free up storage**: Delete unused apps or media
4. **Update iOS**: Ensure you're on the latest iOS version
5. **Reinstall app**: Delete and reinstall from App Store

## I can't delete my account

To delete your account:

1. Go to **Profile** > **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Account Management**
