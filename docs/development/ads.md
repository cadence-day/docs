# Join Our Team: Develop and Own a Company

At Cadence.day, we're seeking software developers to help build our [mobile app]().

We're currently in the early stages and not generating revenue yet, so we can primarily offer equity in our company.

Our mission is to support mental health through a new approach to tracking time, habits, and patterns—one that moves away from productivist thinking. We don't believe in productivity for its own sake, but rather in achieving balance through meaningful time allocation across different life domains.

We've identified 10 domains where most daily activities fall, but we empower users to define the activities they want to focus on.

Currently, our app is basic with manual logging features, but we're expanding to include predictive models using device location, user biometrics, and calendar integration.

Our team consists of 3 co-founders: 2 Americans with European roots and 1 Belgian. We're based in Copenhagen, Berlin, and New York, working fully asynchronously and remotely. Our diverse backgrounds span education, gender studies, filmmaking, engineering, SaaS software, health tech, architecture, and business consultancy. We prioritize thoughtful processes over the traditional "Get Shit Done" mentality.

## Our Values

- **Transparency**: Full access to our Discord with all discussions—we have nothing to hide
- **Honesty**: We understand that burnout is real. If you can't complete a task, just be honest and we'll find a solution together
- **Flexibility**: We don't follow rigid schedules. Check Discord to see who's working, and feel free to initiate collaborative sessions—we love spontaneous collaboration
- **Anti-capitalist & Anti-productivist**: We operate as a flat organization where everyone has a voice. Financials and platform revenue will be completely transparent. We offer ownership to significant contributors through various reward structures: employee stock options, recurring salaries, contractual arrangements, etc.

We're agile, open-minded, and yes—a little unconventional!
