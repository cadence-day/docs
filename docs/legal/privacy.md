# Privacy Policy for Cadence Visual Time Tracking App

_Effective Date: 05.01.2025_

Cadence ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use the Cadence Time Tracking app (the “App”) distributed via the Apple App Store. We take a conservative approach to data collection and only collect the minimal data necessary to operate and improve the App.

## Information We Do Not Collect

- We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly provided by the user.
- We do not access your device contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or location.
- We do not track you across other apps or websites.

## Information We May Collect

- **Account Information (if applicable):** Email address (if required for login or sync), stored in hashed or encrypted form.
- **Usage Data:** Time entries (e.g., start and end times, task labels). App interactions (e.g., button taps) for debugging and improvement (anonymized).
- **Device Information:** Device model, OS version, and app version for compatibility and diagnostics (non-personal).

All data is stored locally on your device unless you explicitly opt-in to sync with our cloud backend.

## Data Storage and Security

All data is end-to-end encrypted during transmission and encrypted at rest on our servers. We employ industry-standard safeguards including TLS, AES-256 encryption, and secure key management. We use Supabase for secure cloud storage and authentication, Clerk for user authentication, and RevenueCat for subscription management. Data shared with these services is protected according to their privacy policies:
