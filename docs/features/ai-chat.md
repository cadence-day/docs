# AI Chat with Sage

Your personal AI companion for insights, reflections, and understanding your life patterns.

## What is Sage?

Sage is Cadence's AI-powered chat assistant, designed to help you understand your data, generate insights, and build meaningful reflection practices. Think of Sage as a thoughtful companion who knows your activity patterns and can help you make sense of them.

**Sage is included with Cadence Premium.**

## Core Capabilities

### Pattern Analysis

Sage analyzes your activity data to identify:

- **Time allocation**: How you're spending your hours
- **Weekly rhythms**: Consistent patterns across weeks
- **Activity balance**: Work-life balance, health habits, etc.
- **Trends over time**: How your patterns are changing

### Conversational Insights

Unlike static reports, Sage provides:

- **Natural language responses**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Context-aware answers**: Sage remembers your conversation
- **Personalized insights**: Based on your unique data
- **Actionable suggestions**: Practical ideas for improvement

### Reflection Generation

Sage can automatically create thoughtful reflections:

- **Daily summaries**: Overview of your day
- **Weekly insights**: Patterns and highlights from the week
- **Custom reflections**: Based on specific activities or themes
- **Gratitude and growth**: Balanced perspective on progress

## How to Use Sage

### Starting a Conversation

1. Tap the **Chat** tab in the bottom navigation
2. Type your question or request
3. Tap **Send** or press enter
4. Wait a few seconds for Sage's thoughtful response

### Example Questions

**Understanding Patterns:**
- "What are my most common activities this week?"
- "How much time do I spend on work vs personal activities?"
- "When do I usually exercise?"
- "What patterns do you notice in my data?"

**Seeking Insights:**
- "Help me reflect on my week"
- "What insights do you have about my work-life balance?"
- "How has my health routine been lately?"
- "Am I spending enough time on creative activities?"

**Specific Analysis:**

- "How has my sleep schedule changed this month?"
- "What activities make me write positive notes?"
- "When am I most productive?"

### Conversation Tips

**Be specific**: "How much time did I spend on exercise this week?" is better than "Tell me about exercise"

**Ask follow-ups**: Sage remembers context, so you can dig deeper: "Tell me more about that" or "What else do you notice?"

**Request reflections**: "Generate a reflection based on this week's activities"

**Explore freely**: There are no wrong questions! Sage is here to help you explore your data.

- **Weekly**: "Help me reflect on this week"
- **Monthly**: "What patterns do you notice over the past month?"

Sage uses all this context to provide deeper insights!

Sage can help track progress toward goals:

- "Am I exercising more consistently than last month?"
