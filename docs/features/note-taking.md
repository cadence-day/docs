# Note-Taking & Voice Capture

Capture thoughts, context, and insights alongside your activities.

## Why Take Notes?

Notes in Cadence serve multiple purposes:

- **Remember context**: What happened during an activity?
- **Capture feelings**: How did you feel?
- **Track insights**: What did you learn?
- **Feed Sage AI**: Give your AI companion more context for better insights

Notes transform simple time tracking into a rich journal of your life.

## Text Notes

### Adding Text Notes

The simplest way to add notes:

1. Tap an activity on your timeline
2. Type your thought in the note field
3. Notes save automatically

**Pro tip**: Keep notes concise but meaningful. Future you will appreciate the context!

### Best Practices for Text Notes

**Good notes:**
- "Great energy after morning run!"
- "Meeting went well - team aligned on Q1 goals"
- "Felt distracted, need better focus tomorrow"

**Less useful notes:**
- "Good" (too vague)
- "Meeting" (obvious from the activity)
- Extremely long paragraphs (save for reflections!)

### Editing Notes

To edit or delete a note:

1. Tap the activity with the note
2. Edit the text or clear it entirely
3. Changes save automatically

## Voice Notes (Premium Feature)

### How Voice-to-Text Works

Cadence Premium includes voice-to-text powered by OpenAI's Whisper:

1. Tap the microphone icon when adding a note
2. Speak for up to 60 seconds
3. Whisper transcribes your speech to text
4. Review and edit if needed
5. Save!

### When to Use Voice

Voice notes are perfect for:

- **On the go**: Capture thoughts while walking or commuting
- **Quick capture**: Faster than typing on mobile
- **Rich context**: Express thoughts more naturally by speaking
- **Accessibility**: Alternative input method

### Voice Note Tips

**For best results:**
- **Speak clearly**: Enunciate for accurate transcription
- **Quiet environment**: Minimize background noise
- **Shorter segments**: Multiple 30-second notes are better than one 60-second note
- **Review**: Always review transcriptions for accuracy

**Privacy note**: Audio is transcribed and then discarded. Only the text is stored (encrypted!).

## Note Organization

### Connecting Notes to Activities

Every note is attached to a specific activity and time slot:

- View notes chronologically on your timeline
- See all notes for a specific activity type
- Review notes in the Reflection screen

This creates a rich, contextual history of your days.

### Searchable Notes (Coming Soon)

Full-text search across all notes is in development! Soon you'll be able to:

- Search for specific topics or keywords
- Find patterns in your thoughts
- Recall when you learned something
- Discover connections between ideas

## Using Notes with Sage AI

### How Sage Uses Your Notes

When you chat with Sage, your notes provide crucial context:

- **Sentiment analysis**: Sage can detect patterns in your emotional state
- **Topic identification**: Understand what's on your mind most often
- **Personalized insights**: More context leads to better advice
- **Reflection generation**: Notes inform AI-generated reflections

### Example Sage Queries

With notes, you can ask Sage:

- "What patterns do you notice in my work notes?"
- "When do I write notes about feeling energized?"
- "Summarize my thoughts from last week"
- "What's been on my mind lately?"

## Privacy & Security

### Encryption

All notes are encrypted using AES-256:

- **End-to-end encryption**: Notes are encrypted on your device
- **Your keys only**: Only you can decrypt your notes
- **Secure storage**: Encrypted data stored in Supabase
- **No access**: Even Cadence employees can't read your notes

### Voice Note Privacy

For voice-to-text:

- **Audio not stored**: Recording is transcribed then immediately deleted
- **Text encrypted**: Only the transcribed text is saved (encrypted)
- **Secure processing**: Audio sent over encrypted connection to OpenAI
- **No training data**: Your audio is never used to train AI models

See our full [Encryption & Privacy](/docs/faq/encryption) guide for details.

## Advanced Note-Taking Strategies

### Daily Highlights

At the end of each day, add a note to a special "Reflection" activity:

- **3 positives**: What went well?
- **1 challenge**: What was difficult?
- **1 learning**: What did you discover?

This creates a powerful daily reflection practice.

### Energy Tracking

Use notes to track your energy levels:

- "High energy - productive morning"
- "Low energy afternoon slump"
- "Recharged after walk"

Over time, you'll identify energy patterns and optimize your schedule.

### Gratitude Notes

Add gratitude to relevant activities:

- "Grateful for team support in meeting"
- "Thankful for beautiful weather on run"
- "Appreciated quiet time to read"

Small gratitude notes boost well-being and positivity.

### Problem Solving

Use notes to work through challenges:

- "Stuck on X problem - need to think differently"
- Later: "Had idea for solving X during walk"
- Later: "Implemented solution - worked perfectly!"

Track your creative problem-solving process.

## Combining Notes and Reflections

### Short Notes â†’ Long Reflections

Notes are quick captures. Reflections are longer, synthesized thoughts:

**During the day**: Add quick notes to activities
**End of week**: Review your notes
**Ask Sage**: "Generate a reflection based on this week's notes"
**Edit & save**: Personalize the AI-generated reflection

This creates a powerful journaling practice with minimal effort.

### Weekly Review Practice

1. **Sunday evening** (or Monday morning):
   - Open Reflection view
   - Read through your week's notes
   - Notice patterns or themes
   - Ask Sage for insights
   - Generate and save a weekly reflection

2. **Monthly review**:
   - Review all weekly reflections
   - Identify longer-term patterns
   - Celebrate progress
   - Adjust activities or habits
