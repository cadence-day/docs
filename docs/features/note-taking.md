# Note-Taking

Capture thoughts, context, and insights alongside your activities.

## Why Take Notes?

Notes in Cadence serve multiple purposes:

- **Remember context**: What happened during an activity?
- **Capture feelings**: How did you feel?
- **Track insights**: What did you learn?

Notes transform simple time tracking into a rich journal of your life.

## Text Notes

### Adding Text Notes

The simplest way to add notes:

1. Tap an activity on your timeline
2. Type your thought in the note field
3. Notes save automatically

**Pro tip**: Keep notes concise but meaningful. Future you will appreciate the context!

### Best Practices for Text Notes

**Good notes:**
- "Great energy after morning run!"
- "Meeting went well - team aligned on Q1 goals"
- "Felt distracted, need better focus tomorrow"

**Less useful notes:**
- "Good" (too vague)
- "Meeting" (obvious from the activity)
- Extremely long paragraphs (save for reflections!)

### Editing Notes

To edit or delete a note:

1. Tap the activity with the note
2. Edit the text or clear it entirely
3. Changes save automatically

## Note Organization

### Connecting Notes to Activities

- **Secure storage**: Encrypted data stored in Supabase

## Advanced Note-Taking Strategies

### Daily Highlights

At the end of each day, add a note to a special "Reflection" activity:

- **3 positives**: What went well?
- **1 challenge**: What was difficult?
- **1 learning**: What did you discover?

This creates a powerful daily reflection practice.

### Energy Tracking

Use notes to track your energy levels:

- "High energy - productive morning"
- "Low energy afternoon slump"
- "Recharged after walk"

Over time, you'll identify energy patterns and optimize your schedule.

### Gratitude Notes

Add gratitude to relevant activities:

- "Grateful for team support in meeting"
- "Thankful for beautiful weather on run"
- "Appreciated quiet time to read"

Small gratitude notes boost well-being and positivity.

### Problem Solving

Use notes to work through challenges:

- "Stuck on X problem - need to think differently"
- Later: "Had idea for solving X during walk"
- Later: "Implemented solution - worked perfectly!"

Track your creative problem-solving process.

## Combining Notes and Reflections

### Short Notes â†’ Long Reflections

Notes are quick captures. Reflections are longer, synthesized thoughts:

**During the day**: Add quick notes to activities
**End of week**: Review your notes
**Edit & save**: Personalize the AI-generated reflection

This creates a powerful journaling practice with minimal effort.
