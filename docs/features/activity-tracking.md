# Activity Tracking

Master the core feature of Cadence: tracking how you spend your time.

## What is Activity Tracking?

Activity tracking in Cadence is a simple but powerful way to understand your daily rhythms. Instead of complex time tracking or productivity apps, Cadence provides an intuitive visual timeline where you can log activities in 30-minute blocks.

## Core Concepts

### The Timeline

The timeline is your daily view where you log activities:

- **24-hour grid**: Each day is divided into 48 time slots (30 minutes each)
- **Visual blocks**: Activities appear as colored blocks
- **Scrollable**: Scroll vertically through your day, horizontally between days
- **Quick logging**: Tap any slot to log an activity

### Activities

Activities are the building blocks of your day:

- **Name**: What you're doing (e.g., "Work", "Exercise", "Reading")
- **Color**: Visual identifier for quick recognition
- **Category**: Group activities by type (Work, Health, Personal, Social, Creative, Learning, Other)
- **Status**: Active or temporarily disabled

## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Activities

During onboarding, you'll select from common activities or create your own. Here's how to create activities anytime:

1. Tap **"Edit Activities"** on the home screen
2. Tap **"+ Add New Activity"**
3. Enter a name (be specific but concise)
4. Choose a category
5. Pick a distinctive color
6. Tap **"Save"**

**Pro tip**: Start with 8-12 core activities. You can always add more later!

### Logging Activities

To log an activity on your timeline:

1. Navigate to the date you want to log
2. Tap on a time slot
3. Select the activity from your list
4. (Optional) Add a note with context or thoughts
5. The activity is saved automatically

**Batch logging**: You can quickly log multiple time slots by dragging across them (coming soon!).

### Editing Activities

Made a mistake? No problem:

1. Tap the activity block you want to change
2. Select a different activity or delete
3. Changes save automatically

## Advanced Features

### Activity Categories

Categories help organize and analyze your time:

- **Work**: Professional tasks, meetings, focused work
- **Health**: Exercise, meditation, self-care
- **Personal**: Chores, cooking, errands, admin
- **Social**: Time with friends, family, community
- **Creative**: Hobbies, art, music, crafts
- **Learning**: Reading, courses, skill development
- **Other**: Everything else!

Use categories to quickly see work-life balance, time spent on health, and other patterns.

### Color System

Choose colors strategically:

- **Similar activities**: Use similar hues (light blue for "Deep Work", dark blue for "Meetings")
- **High priority**: Use vibrant colors for important activities
- **Passive time**: Use muted colors for rest or passive activities
- **Personal system**: Develop a color coding that makes sense to you

### Temporarily Disabling Activities

Life changes! When you don't need an activity for a while:

1. Go to **"Edit Activities"**
2. Tap the activity
3. Enable **"Temporarily disable activity"**
4. Tap **"Save"**

Disabled activities:
- Won't appear when logging time
- Can be re-enabled anytime
- Don't delete your historical data

## Best Practices

### How Much Detail?

The right level of detail varies by person:

**Too broad**: "Work" (doesn't help identify patterns)
**Too detailed**: "Email - Client A - Project X" (exhausting to maintain)
**Just right**: "Email", "Meetings", "Deep Work", "Admin"

Start broader and add detail where it helps you understand patterns.

### Consistency Matters

For meaningful insights:

- **Log daily**: Even if you do it all at once in the evening
- **Be honest**: Log the real activity, not the ideal one
- **Keep categories stable**: Don't rename frequently or insights get muddled
- **Review weekly**: Check your patterns in the Reflection view

### Strategic Activity Design

Think about what you want to learn:

**Want to understand work-life balance?**
- Separate "Work" from personal activities
- Track "Family Time" separately from other social time

**Want to improve health habits?**
- Track "Exercise", "Meditation", "Cooking healthy meals" specifically
- Include "Screen time" or "Social media" to identify time drains

**Want to build creative practices?**
- Create distinct activities for different creative pursuits
- Track "Reading" vs "Writing" vs "Art" separately

## Integration with Other Features

### Notes

Add context to activities:

- Quick thoughts: "Great energy today!"
- Important details: "Discussed Q1 goals with team"
- Feelings: "Felt anxious during this meeting"

Notes help Sage AI provide better insights and help you remember details later.

### Reflections

Use activity tracking as the foundation for reflections:

- Review your week visually
- Notice patterns in timing and frequency
- Generate reflections with Sage based on your activities

### Timeline Navigation

Efficiently navigate your activity history:

- **Swipe**: Move between days quickly
- **Calendar picker**: Jump to any date
- **Today button**: Return to current day instantly
- **Reflection view**: See your whole week at once

## Common Patterns

### Morning Routines

Track your morning activities to optimize your start:

- Meditation
- Exercise
- Breakfast
- Email/Planning
- Deep Work

Notice what mornings feel best and replicate them!

### Work Blocks

Understand your productive time:

- Deep Work (focused individual work)
- Meetings (collaborative time)
- Email/Slack (communication)
- Admin (administrative tasks)
- Breaks (rest and recovery)

Identify your peak productive hours and protect them.

### Evening Rituals

Build healthy evening routines:

- Cooking
- Family Time
- Reading
- Journaling/Reflection
- Sleep Prep

Track these to ensure you're winding down effectively.

## Troubleshooting

### "I forget to log activities"

- **Set reminders**: Use notification settings to prompt logging
- **Batch log**: Set aside 5 minutes each evening to log the day
- **Be forgiving**: Missing a day occasionally is fine
- **Review calendar**: Use your calendar to remember what you did

### "I can't decide between similar activities"

- **Combine them**: If "Email" and "Slack" feel too similar, just use "Communication"
- **Ask yourself**: "Will tracking these separately give me useful insights?"
- **Simplify**: Fewer, broader activities are easier to maintain

### "My activities change seasonally"

- **Disable, don't delete**: Temporarily disable off-season activities
- **Create seasonal variants**: "Summer Sports" vs "Winter Sports"
- **Review quarterly**: Adjust your activity list every few months

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with basic tracking:

1. **Add context with notes**: Start adding thoughts and reflections
2. **Chat with Sage**: Ask questions about your patterns
3. **Review weekly**: Use the Reflection screen to understand your rhythms
4. **Optimize your days**: Use insights to design better days

Activity tracking is just the beginning - the real power comes from understanding your patterns over time!
