# Reflections

Build a meaningful reflection practice to understand your patterns and growth.

## What are Reflections?

Reflections in Cadence are longer-form thoughts about your days, weeks, or specific patterns. Unlike quick activity notes, reflections are:

- **Synthesized insights**: Pulling together patterns from multiple activities
- **Meaningful**: Focused on understanding, growth, and awareness
- **Periodic**: Typically weekly, but can be daily or monthly
- **AI-assisted**: Sage can help generate thoughtful reflections

## Why Reflect?

Reflection is a powerful practice:

- **Self-awareness**: Understand your patterns and rhythms
- **Pattern recognition**: Notice what's working and what isn't
- **Course correction**: Adjust habits based on insights
- **Gratitude**: Recognize positives and progress
- **Documentation**: Build a journal of your journey

Regular reflection transforms raw data into wisdom about your life.

## Reflection Frameworks

### The 3-2-1 Method

A simple, powerful framework:

- **3 things that went well**
- **2 things that were challenging**
- **1 thing to focus on next week**

Works great for weekly reflections!

### The 4 Quadrants

Organize reflections by area:

- **Work/Professional**: Projects, meetings, productivity
- **Health/Physical**: Exercise, sleep, nutrition
- **Relationships/Social**: Family, friends, community
- **Personal/Creative**: Hobbies, learning, growth

### The Energy Audit

Reflect on energy patterns:

- **What gave me energy?** (Do more of this!)
- **What drained my energy?** (Minimize or eliminate)
- **When was I in flow?** (Protect this time)
- **When did I struggle?** (Why? Can I change it?)

### The Gratitude Lens

Focus on positives:

- **Big wins**: Major accomplishments
- **Small joys**: Everyday pleasures
- **People**: Who supported or inspired you?
- **Learnings**: What did you discover?

## Building a Reflection Habit

### Find Your Rhythm

Experiment to find what works:

- **Day**: Sunday evening? Monday morning? Friday afternoon?
- **Duration**: 5 minutes? 20 minutes?

## Example Reflection

**Sample weekly reflection (AI-generated then personalized):**

> **Week of Oct 6-12, 2025**
>
> This week felt more balanced than last. I managed to exercise 4 times (up from 2!), and I notice I have more energy on days I work out in the morning. Work was busy but productive - I protected two 2-hour deep work blocks each day which made a huge difference.
>
> Challenging: I didn't spend much time on creative projects. Only one hour of reading. I want to protect weekend mornings for this.
>
> Grateful for: The team lunch on Wednesday - great conversation and connection. Also grateful I'm building more consistent exercise habits.
>
> Next week: Keep morning exercise going, and block Saturday 9-11am for creative time. Maybe try that new coffee shop for a change of scenery.

## Tips for Meaningful Reflections

1. **Be honest**: Reflect on reality, not the ideal
2. **Balance perspective**: Notice good AND challenging
3. **Look for patterns**: What repeats week to week?
4. **Stay curious**: Ask "why?" about your patterns
5. **Take action**: Use insights to make small changes
6. **Be patient**: Patterns emerge over time
7. **Celebrate wins**: Notice and appreciate progress

Reflection isn't about perfection - it's about awareness, growth, and living more intentionally!
