# Activities Page Integration

## Overview
The activities page has been successfully integrated into the app folder structure using Expo Router. This implementation demonstrates the full power of our optimized Zustand stores.

## Routes Created

### `/app/(home)/activities.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main activities management page
- **Route**: Accessible via `./activities` from the home screen
- **Features**: Full CRUD operations for activities with category support

### Updated Files

#### `/app/(home)/index.tsx`
- Added navigation button to activities page
- Improved styling and user experience
- Maintained authentication flow

#### `/app/(home)/_layout.tsx` 
- Added consistent header styling
- Configured stack navigation

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Complete Activity Management
- Create new activities with category selection
- View all activities with category information
- Enable/disable activities
- Delete activities (soft delete)
- Real-time loading states and error handling

### ‚úÖ Category Integration
- Horizontal scrollable category picker
- Visual feedback for selected categories
- Option to create activities without categories

### ‚úÖ User Experience
- Native mobile UI components
- Responsive design
- Loading indicators
- Error messages
- Confirmation dialogs

### ‚úÖ Store Integration
- Uses optimized `useActivitiesStore`
- Uses `useActivityCategoriesStore`
- Demonstrates store utility patterns
- Type-safe throughout

## Usage

1. **Start the app**: `npm start` or `expo start`
2. **Navigate**: From home screen, tap "üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Manage Activities"
3. **Create activities**: Fill form and select optional category
4. **Manage activities**: Use action buttons to enable/disable/delete

## Technical Implementation

### Store Usage
```tsx
const {
  activities,
  isLoading: activitiesLoading,
  error: activitiesError,
  insertActivity,
  refresh: refreshActivities,
  softDeleteActivity,
  disableActivity,
  updateActivity,
} = useActivitiesStore();
```

### Navigation
```tsx
<Link href="./activities" asChild>
  <TouchableOpacity style={styles.navButton}>
    <Text style={styles.navButtonText}>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Manage Activities</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</Link>
```

### Error Handling
```tsx
const handleCreateActivity = async () => {
  try {
    const newActivity = await insertActivity({...});
    if (newActivity) {
      Alert.alert("Success", "Activity created successfully!");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert("Error", "Failed to create activity");
  }
};
```

## Testing

1. **Authentication**: Ensure user is signed in
2. **Create Activity**: Test form validation and submission
3. **Categories**: Test category loading and selection
4. **CRUD Operations**: Test all activity operations
5. **Error States**: Test network errors and validation
6. **Navigation**: Test routing between pages

## Next Steps

This implementation serves as a template for other feature pages:
- Notes management
- Sage (AI chat) interface  
- Calendar integration
- Settings pages

The same patterns can be applied to any new features using the optimized store utilities we created.
